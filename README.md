## Optimizations

I would perhap make the instructions toggleable and added animations that reveal and play upon click to make the game feel more immersive.

## Lessons Learned:

Reinforced the Separation of Concerns. Learned basic applications of Math.Random to simulate bot AI. Also reinforced my comfort with Event Listeners.
